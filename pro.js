    "I got my first computer on Christmas, a giant box stuck half-haphazardly under the Christmas tree. It was a Chromebook, as was the trend of the time, a finnicky but hardy little machine. I did a lot on that Chromebook; I learned to code, learned to write, learned to draw.",

    "People get their first phones at such different ages. I got mine just about at the mean, when I first started riding the bus in sixth grade. My first phone was an iPhone SE, this tiny device that had a screen the size of a modern camera bump. It was the first taste I had of being able to call people without being in front of them; it was my first time asking people for their number rather than their address.",

    "Around 2019, AirPods were blowing up. Everyone had them, everyone wanted them. I, on the other hand, had just barely gotten a phone. So instead of AirPods - which at the time were about the same price as the handset they'd be connected to - I got some cheap wireless earbuds off of a Chinese site.",
    "They were a gamechanger. I could listen to my own music, watch my own things, consume podcasts and audiobooks. Importantly, I could do these things with other people - but I didn't have to do them with everyone. No longer would my audio become the communal jukebox; now, my sound was mine alone."
