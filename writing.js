    "I first learned to write in Korean. I scribbled something resembling 아빠 - or maybe it was 엄마, my handwriting too illegible to tell the difference between DAD and MOM.",
    "When I started school in Pre-K, I still couldn't speak English. I learned to read, write, and talk at the same time, my impressionable young mind learning so much faster that I can today. I learned how to say I wanted to go to the bathroom, learned how to say <i>I love you</i>, learned that English was a language I could never truly master.",
    "Then in elementary school, I started reading. At first I read what all 6 year olds read - Clifford, Arthur, Flat Stanley. But then I started reading more than just <i>I Can Read</i> books. I picked up <i>The One and Only Ivan</i>, <i>Out of My Mind</i>, <i>Wonder</i>. I learned that words could make you <mark>feel</mark> something.",
    "By the time I moved to Texas in fourth grade, I was already starting to write on my own. I wrote stories about robots and superheroes, jotted down in crayon on printer paper. They weren't good stories, but they were <i>mine</i>. I was inventing worlds, creating characters, defining relationships.",
    "In middle school, I discovered politics. I didn't understand half of it - I still don't - but I knew that there were a few things that I <b>did</b> understand. So I wrote about them.",
    "I started writing essays, not creating worlds but trying to fix the one I live in. I wrote less about joyfully defeating giant monsters and more about fighting the losing battle we call life. That sounds depressing, but to me, it was a creative outlet. It was a way to be heard, at an age where nobody listens.It was like donning a mask at a ball, dancing with those who'd normally never spare you a second glance.",
    "In eighth grade, I submitted an essay to my first ever writing competition. By some stroke of unimaginable luck, I won a national gold medal. I got to go to New York and attend a ceremony, talk about writing with other people like me.",
    "Eighth grade, however, wasn't a perfect year. An accusation of plagiarism from a teacher and a librarian who seemed intent on bullying students introduced me to what it felt like to write with emotion - though that might not have been the greatest way to learn how. More importantly, I learned how to properly revise my writing, how to articulate my turbulent thoughts into an elegant piece of writing.",
    "Today, I still enjoy writing essays - in fact, I share a few select pieces that I like on my personal blog. One of my biggest goals in writing, however, is to get better at \"the other stuff\". I want to be able to espouse poetry, write fiction, script plays. I've only written for ten years, yet I can only imagine what I can do in ten more."
