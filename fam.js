    "I moved to Texas in 4th grade from Arizona, a stark contrast as I went from going to a small private school in the hottest place in the northern hemisphere to a large public school in a city known to be so humid you could practically lick the condensation off a window.",
    "Moving was hard - I left behind friends I thought I would grow up with, skipped a grade and ended up surrounded by students a year older than me, had to adapt to a different culture and climate. But in doing so, I made countless invaluable friends and learned to do so many things; I joined Boy Scouts, started learning clarinet, picked up saying \"ya'll\" and \"ain't\".",
    "Throughout that time, my family was a pillar of stability. My mother and father, but also my aunt and uncle who live in Bellaire. Our Thanksgiving get-togethers, our Christmas mornings - those were the constants that helped me settle into this new environment.",
    "Though I can't visit Korea often, when I do, I always go to see my grandparents in Busan. They always have something good to say - never a truth bomb or a life-changer, just little tidbits and idioms that make you look at things a different way.",
    "Of course, it's impossible to talk about family and influences without considering the present. Today, my family remains mostly the same - we've settled into our not-so-new home, into our not-so-new routine.",
    "I'll soon have spent more of my youth in Texas than in Arizona; by the end of the year, I'll be able to say that I grew up in the Lone Star state. It's bittersweet, like letting go and giving in at the same time, like moving on and embracing all at once.",
    "Maybe one day I'll be ready to really say I've moved on. But not yet. Not today."
