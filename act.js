    <small>This is a project programmed entirely from scratch by William Choi-Kim.</small>`,
    "Many say that one is not defined by one's actions nor one's words. But to me, the things I do - the things I enjoy - are the components of the abstract thing I call my soul.",
    "On a train to Paris, I picked up a program called Hopscotch. It was a block-coding app like the now pervasive Scratch, a simplified version of programming meant for children.",
    "I fit pretty well into that age category, and I fell pretty well into the target audience of the app. I made countless games on Hopscotch, spending several years on the app before moving on to more advanced programming.",
    "In my freshman year of high school, I won my first award for doing art. This was new to me; I'd been told I could write and code and calculate, but never that I could do art. It was validating that somebody out there thought what I made looked good, felt good.",
    "To me, that's what makes art vital. It's ability to make a person feel some way. It's ability to make its artist question themselves, question their emotions. That's what makes art a component of me.",
    "Last year, I was the regional UIL champion for Ready Writing. That, after a year of disappointing competition results in different writing series, was a much-needed dose of recognition.",
    "To be able to sit in a room with some of the best writers in the region - in the state - and compete was exhilarating and incredibly fun. And while I might have already believed in my ability to write, last year's result showed me that I wasn't deluding myself. Sometimes, that's exactly what you need."
