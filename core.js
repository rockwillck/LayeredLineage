    "I don't believe in the idea of an unchanging belief - axioms are meant for mathematics, not for personal development.",
    "But that in and of itself is, in a way, an unchanging belief. It is my doctrine that a person unwilling to be convinced of the falsehood of even their most core belief is a person unwilling to grow.",
    "That belief comes from my own experience. I have been able to become the person I am by arguing with friends, arguing with family, arguing with myself. I have been able to become the person I am because I was persuaded and dissuaded by those around me. I will continue to grow, continue to change, continue to believe different things.",
    "I also believe that there is no such thing as a hopeless situation. When I came to Texas, I was alone, the runt of my class. Yet today, I've surrounded myself with friends I would give the world for. Even before in Arizona, when I couldn't speak English, I made do and learned.",
    "This belief too may change when I first encounter an insurmountable challenge - but until the day I do so, I hope to live believing every hurdle can be jumped, every wall knocked down.",
    "In the end, my dogmatic nature is limited and mercurial. But in believing that it does not serve me to believe, I allow myself to live as I have lived, yet also as I never have before. To me, that's life - but maybe that will change too."
