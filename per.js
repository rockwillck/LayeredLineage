    "When I was eight years old, I wanted this robot dog called Chip. It was a kid's toy, a simple gadget meant to entertain briefly with cute sound effects and pseudo-affectionate behavior.",
    "Of course, my parents said no. And of course, I didn't take no for an answer. I bargained, I bartered, I begged. For the first time in my life, I was motivated to persuade someone of something they opposed.",
    "Four years later, when I entered middle school, I made some new friends. Older friends, upperclassmen in seventh and eighth grade. They seemed so mature, so developed. And, as is natural of a sixth grade feeling intimidated and out of place, I started arguing.",
    "Not fighting, just arguing about everything - semantics, politics, science, things I couldn't pronounce nor define. In the process, I unwittingly learned a lot; I learned about the topics I was debating, about the art of argumentation, about the beauty of a good debate.",
    "The next year, I started writing essays to argue not just with my friends, but with the world. I learned to do a little bit more than just argue my point; I learned to gather evidence, present counterexamples, consider every point of view. I learned that sometimes, proving that you're right also means admitting that you could be wrong."
